<i> An introspective of my time as a Moderator at Hypixel.

I've done a lot of Moderation work, after all, I enjoy solving problems, and offering help. I held many voluntarily positions before I became a staff member at Hypixel in 2017, from a large Factions server SaiCoPvP, to connecting and having liaison with Managers and staff members from other servers like Arkham, CosmicMC, and others.

Eventually, all my prior experience led to me seek an opportunity to help as many people as possible, and where better to do this than the largest Minecraft server, with over 100,000 concurrent players?

## My 4+ Year Timeline

When I first joined the staff team, I was a Helper for a year, and this year was one of the most educational, and difficult years I've had to work in Moderation. I hadn't moderated for a server the size of Hypixel before, the largest server I had worked in was around 5,000 players, this was shallow compared to Hypixel's 50-60-70k it was pushing at the time (since then gaining over 200,000 concurrent players).

### 2017

I spent the first year dealing with a lot of advertisers, and handing out a lot of chat punishments for players who broke the server regulations. I was trying to spend a consistent amount of time in-game each day, which was around 3 hours, eventually being consistent helped with my promotion when I applied for a Moderator role in 2018, and was accepted after around a year as a Helper.

### 2018 - 2021

As a Moderator, you have a lot more responsibilities, and are looked up to significantly more than in a Helper role, so it's important to remain professional, and treat the players fairly. The end goal of Moderation I did was simply to make the players happy. If you're making the players happy this will have a positive net effect on the server - players are customers.

I collaborated a lot more with other staff as a Moderator, from staff party's, to group members working together to get through reports submitted by players. Dealing with thousands upon thousands of reports was fun, and I held even more of a connection to players in-game as their feedback was important to me.

I also helped train a lot of Moderators; some of which are currently working as Game Masters. Training others is great, it helps you improve areas you may be blind to, as well as offer your expertise to recently promoted staff. My favorite memory was being one of the team leaders for the last Moderation waves in 2021.

### The Move To A Paid Team

August 2021 the staff team moved to a team of paid Game Masters, which was to ensure that the server was receiving proper moderation, and it would allow the team to be more efficient, after all, you're more inclined to offer a high-level of service if you're paid.

Departing the team was quite sad for me, as I had spent my late teens with a lot of members on the team, met some great people, and learned a lot. I just always liked to help others, so as an active Moderator, it wasn't ideal; I still had a lot to offer.

Regardless, the four years I was a Moderator, was great, I met a ton of fantastic people, and I've missed being on the team since then--I'd do it again within the blink of an eye!

## My Hypixel Jersey

Receiving a Hypixel Jersey arranged by Robity - a staff manager at the time, was surreal to me, given that Moderators and Helpers held a voluntary status. Receiving the jersey felt prestigious, it wasn't a cheap jersey either, and the materials were woven very well.

I prefer to keep my jersey hung up, as it's something I cherish, so I wouldn't want to somehow ruin the jersey in anyway.

Here's how it looks! <img src="/images/my-jersey.png" size="200" height="200">
