I'm Luke, a software engineer who's been on an exciting coding journey since my teenage years. My initial foray into programming was through game and plugin development for Minecraft servers, and from there, I've ventured into the vast world of software engineering.

Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, I thrive in difficult, fast-paced settings. It's my belief that true learning happens when faced with challenges, and I welcome every opportunity to expand my skill set.

My coding repertoire spans over six years of expertise in Java, along with HTML/CSS, Javascript, Typescript, Python, C++, Rust, and proficiency in technologies like Git, Spring Boot, and REST. Agile Scrum, CI/CD, and API creation are integral parts of my toolkit, allowing me to create innovative solutions and maintain code in expansive projects.

However, my interests extend beyond code. I go by qbb84, where 'q' signifies my fascination with quantum concepts, and 'bb84' nods to quantum key encryption.
