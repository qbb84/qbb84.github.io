I'm Luke, a seasoned software engineer who's been on an exciting coding journey since my teenage years. My initial foray into programming was through game and plugin development for Minecraft servers, and from there, I've ventured into the vast world of software engineering.

In the gaming realm, I'm not just a developer; I'm an avid player. Games like WoW, FFXIV, and the immersive worlds of MMORPGs have been a constant source of inspiration and enjoyment for me. I understand firsthand the intricate balance between gameplay and code, having crafted and optimized various gaming experiences.

My professional path extends beyond gaming, encompassing roles in customer support and, moderation/administration within gaming communities, and fixing bugs to ensure seamless gameplay. I find joy in the dynamic challenges of these environments, where effective communication and collaboration with fellow developers are paramount.

Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, I thrive in difficult, fast-paced settings. It's my belief that true learning happens when faced with challenges, and I welcome every opportunity to expand my skill set.

My coding repertoire spans over six years of expertise in Java, along with HTML/CSS, Javascript, Typescript, Python, C++, Rust, and proficiency in technologies like Git, Spring Boot, and REST. Agile Scrum, CI/CD, and API creation are integral parts of my toolkit, allowing me to create innovative solutions and maintain code in expansive projects.

However, my interests extend beyond code. I go by qbb84, where 'q' signifies my fascination with quantum concepts, and 'bb84' nods to quantum key encryption. In my free time, I explore the mysteries of physics, ponder the origins of consciousness, and dive into the profound questions the universe poses. Reality, to me, feels like an incline toward understanding, and I'm on a quest to ascend that slope.
